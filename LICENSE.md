In simple terms, to be interpreted with common sense:

You may:
- Use this software free of charge.
- Distribute this software for free as long as you say that it's from this GitHub repository.
- Be inspired by this game to create your own. (There's no shame in it!)

You may not:
- Charge for or sell this software.
- Use this software for profit or gain.
- Create derivative works without explicit permission (my coding sucks anyway...).

I may:
- Do whatever I bloody well like with my work.
- Change this license for future versions of the game.
- Have my cake.
- Eat my cake.
