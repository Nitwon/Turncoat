I, A.I.
=======

In "I, A.I." you are a robot who must make right what is wrong.

It is a Python 2 text adventure which serves mainly as a learning excercise for
me to learn how to program. As such, I imagine the style will be terrible!

If you want to properly play this game, I suggest that you don't try it until
it's finished, so that there are no spoilers.

I'm also only just getting used to using GitHub, so... yeah.
