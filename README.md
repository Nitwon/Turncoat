Turncoat
========

In Turncoat, you are a robot who must fight its own kind to save humanity.

It is a Python 2 text adventure which serves mainly as a learning excercise for
me to learn how to program. As such, I imagine the style will be terrible!

If you want to properly play this game, I suggest that you don't try it until
it's finished, so that there are no spoilers.

I'm also only just getting used to using GitHub, so... yeah.

How to play
===========

Download Python 2.7.6 from http://www.python.org/download/ and install it, if you don't already have it.

Put main.py and menu.py (from the latest NUMBERED version, e.g. v0.2) in a folder together and run menu.py.

Google is your friend!
